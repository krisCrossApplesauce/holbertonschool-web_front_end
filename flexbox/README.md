# Flexbox

This project has honestly proven itself to be nothing, but useless busy work. 
Anybody who sees this and wants to learn how flexboxes work should look up flexboxfroggy instead and do that. 
This project makes me wonder what other busy work projects that we've had could've been as simple yet helpful as flexboxfroggy. 
I think there's a high chance that there's a good chunk of learning I'm missing out on because of the poor quality of a fair amount of the projects in this curriculum. 
It feels like there's a lot of foundational information that I'm missing out on because they're so stubborn about teaching self learning that they never even provide us with some of the bare necessities. 
I think there's a better balance that could be had that would properly teach really important information, allowing us to more genuinely understand it, while still promoting self learning.
